# GitHub User Activity

[Project URL](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity)

## Running the project

### Requirements

1. **Node.js** must be instaled on the system. [Click here](https://nodejs.org/en) to install it. I have used version `20.17.0` for the project. It should work with other versions as well.

### Steps

- Clone the github repository from `https://github.com/himanshu-pareek/roadmapsh-backend-projects`.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/himanshu-pareek/roadmapsh-backend-projects.git
    ```
- Go to `github-activity` directory:
    ```shell
    cd roadmap-backend-projects
    cd task-tracker
    ```
- Use the following command to get the recent github activity of the user. Replace the `<username>` with the actual username of github user for whom you want to fetch the recent activity:
    ```shell
    ./github-activity <username>
